### PetitJean Index of Chemical Molecules
 
- This project was done for a Computational Drug Design course
- Chemical structures have two shape coefficients.
- The first is based upon graph theory and is calculated from the compoundâ€™s atom-bond graph.
- The other is the geometrical shape coefficient, which is determined by its geometrical shape - which we wish to measure.

#### This workflow allows you to obtain the petitjean index of a chemical molecule in a MOL file, or a combination of those in an SDF file, or a group of mixed MOL and SDF files.

#### In addition, you can obtain 2D images of the molecules in your MOL & SDF files - saved in an output images.zip
